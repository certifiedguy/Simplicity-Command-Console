# Description
The *Simplicity - Command Console* is a stand alone system that is forged in the most lit way possible. What may seem Simple (cough cough Simplicity) is really a work of art, using the best coding practices (*cough cough excluding the times when I mistakenly rush it*) known to man- and womenkind.

I encourage everyone to learn from this project by dissecting and interacting with it's source code and make your own projects for whatever reason suits oneself. This is a hobby project.
